Bash Quote
**********

The Bash Quote tool contains humorous quotes about MediaWiki development and general
software development wisdom.  Bash pulls all quotes from ``app/quote.yml``, which
means you can replace the quotes with any relevant to your wiki.

Inside the Bash Quote tool, there is a "random" link which will give a random quote
from the database.  There's also the ability to search based on a quote ID.  Or,
if you'd rather have humour in large batches, there is an "All" button which shows
all of the quotes currently in the database.
